This project focuses on designing and developing a functional and user-friendly website while also providing training on website development. The goal of the project is to help participants understand how websites are created, designed, and maintained.
During the project, a website will be developed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will be responsive, easy to navigate, and suitable for different users and devices. Attention will be given to layout design, content organization, and basic interactivity.
In addition to building the website, the project includes training sessions for learners. These training sessions will cover basic concepts of web development, including website structure, page design, and simple coding practices. Participants will gain hands-on experience by creating and editing web pages themselves
